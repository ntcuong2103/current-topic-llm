#### Guidelines for the Presentation
 Presentations should be **no longer than 50 minutes**, excluding interruptions. However, presenters should anticipate and be prepared to address questions and interruptions during their talk.

During your presentation, you are expected to:
- **Provide a concise background** to introduce and motivate the problem (e.g., referencing prior talks for simplicity).
- **Explain the main idea, approach, and/or key insight** from the required reading (use examples whenever appropriate).
- **Cover technical details** to help the audience grasp the key points without needing to closely read the material (provide a quick overview of evaluations).
- **Highlight differences** between the required reading and related works, including any additional readings.
- **Discuss strengths and weaknesses** of the required reading and suggest potential directions for future research.

Submission of slides:
- **Deadlines:** Slides for the presentation must be submitted to Moodle (by creating new Thread in Discussion) at least 24 hours before the scheduled class.

#### Guidelines for the Report

The presentation group need to complete **1 summary for "required" papers in a single topic** within 1 week after class presentation.


Each summary should address the following questions in **2-3 pages** with sufficient detail:
1. **What is the problem being addressed**, and why is it important?
2. **What is the state of related works** in this topic?
3. **What solution is proposed**, and what is the key insight guiding the solution?
4. **What are the drawbacks or limitations** of the proposed solution?
5. **What potential directions** could be explored in future research?
6. Highlight of the Q&A session

- **Format:** We provide [this template](Reports/template.pdf) for your reference. We suggest that you can use Google Docs to enable in-line comments and suggestions.

Best Practices:
- Allocate enough time to read and understand the assigned papers.
- Discuss the papers as a group to share perspectives and insights.
- Write the summary carefully, ensuring clarity and completeness.
- Incorporate key observations from the class discussion in your final submission.
